# METIS fork

This is a fork of the [METIS](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/download) graph partitioning software from the [Karypis group](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/george-karypis).
The current version of the forked source code is 5.1.0.
The fork is intended to provide a stable location for source code used by [APBS](https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs) and other software packages that depend on METIS.
